**why you want to learn typescript , why its better then javaScript**

Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and advanced features to the language. It helps developers to catch potential errors during compilation. With Typescript, you can enjoy the benefits of object-oriented programming and compile-time error checking, making your code more maintainable and reliable.

It was develop my microsoft on oct,1,2012, and now its open source with large community support.

any valid javaScript code is also a valid typescript code.

Its providing extra features like interface,tuples,enums,geneeric,classs and so on.

# TypeScript types:

In TypeScript, types are an essential feature, providing a way to add additional information about values. This can be very helpful in catching errors during compile time instead of runtime, and helps with tooling support, such as auto-completion and refactoring.

1: Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.

2: Number: Represents both integers and floating-point values.

3: String: Represents a sequence of characters.
